# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- **SVGMobject id preservation**: elements keep their SVG `id` (children of a
  `<g id>` inherit it), addressable via `svg.byId("sun")` (returns a live
  `VGroup` of the rendered mobjects — style/transform mutations apply in
  place), `svg.hasId(id)`, and the `svg.ids` map. Ids inside
  `<defs>`/`<clipPath>`/gradients are consumed for `url(#id)` resolution and
  never appear. `byId` on an unknown id throws listing the available ids.

- **Seeded noise module** (`src/core/noise.ts`): `valueNoise1D(seed)`,
  `simplex2D(seed)` / `simplex3D(seed)` (per-seed shuffled permutation
  tables), and `fbm(noise)` / `fbm3(noise)` fractal sums with
  `octaves`/`lacunarity`/`gain`. All fields are pure functions of
  (seed, coordinates) — order-independent, scrub-safe, render-cache-safe.
  `mulberry32` now lives here (still re-exported from its old path);
  `wiggle()` output is bit-identical to before (pinned by regression
  vectors).

- **PieChart** (`src/mobject/charts.ts`): pie/donut charts with one
  addressable sector per value (`chart.slices`), clockwise layout from
  `startAngle`, `innerRadius` donut mode, `gapAngle` slice separation, and
  percent / custom / per-slice labels. `setValues()` rebuilds geometry in
  place — same-count updates keep each slice mobject's identity, so
  Transforms and updater references stay valid.

- **WordCaptionTrack** (`src/captions/caption_track.ts`): word-level karaoke
  captions — one text mobject per token from `createTikTokStyleCaptions`
  pages, so the active word can pop (`highlight.scale` over
  `highlight.popMs`) and recolor independently while future words dim
  (`futureOpacity`), TikTok/Submagic style. `maxWidth` wraps tokens into
  centered lines. Styling is a pure function of the caption clock: `seekMs`
  in either direction and updater-driven playback land on identical frames.

- **GeoJSON maps** (`src/loaders/geojson_loader.ts`): `loadGeoJSON(textOrObject,
  {projection, nameProperty, width/height/point, simplifyTolerance})` returns a
  `GeoMap` whose `regions` are addressable by feature name (`byName` for
  choropleths) and whose `project([lon, lat])` maps coordinates through the
  same fit transform — markers and arcs land exactly on their regions.
  Polygon/MultiPolygon (holes as opposite-winding subpaths, safe under both
  evenodd and nonzero fills), LineString/MultiLineString (stroke-only),
  Douglas-Peucker simplification, `mercator`/`equirectangular`/custom
  projections (`src/loaders/geo_projection.ts`). Synchronous (pure JSON+math).

- **ParticleSystem** (`src/mobject/particles.ts`): deterministic particles —
  every particle is a closed-form function of (seed, index, time), with
  analytic ballistics under gravity + linear drag, so scrubbing, backward
  seeks, `alwaysRedraw`, and the render cache work unmodified. Emitter
  point/disc/line, rate/lifetime/speed/spread ranges, size + opacity over
  life, `colorRamp`, `maxParticles` cap, circle/square shapes, `setTime()`
  explicit clock and deterministic `burst(atT, count)` cohorts. Rasterized
  directly by CanvasRenderer (2D and 3D-overlay; effects compose); SVG/WebGL
  backends skip (documented in `docs/renderers.md`).

- **Scene templates + themes** (`src/templates/`): pure factories returning
  `{ group, animateIn(), animateOut() }` — never auto-playing, so they
  compose with `Timeline`/transitions: `titleCard`, `lowerThird`,
  `statCounter` (ValueTracker-driven DecimalNumber with
  `playThrough(runTime)`), `socialShort` (9:16 header/content/caption
  scaffold with safe margins and auto-fit), `chartReveal` (staggers
  BarChart bars / PieChart slices), `outroCard`. Themed via `resolveTheme`
  (StylePreset-aware, including `registerStylePreset`'d plugin presets) with
  accent/fontScale/margin and a foreground color derived from the
  background's luminance.

- **Visual effects pipeline** (`src/core/effects.ts` + renderer support):
  per-mobject `blur` / `glow` / `dropShadow` / `colorAdjust`
  (brightness/contrast/saturate/hueRotate) / seeded `noise`, via a fluent
  Mobject API (`mob.blur(4).glow(8, "#58C4DD")`), plus camera-level
  full-frame grading (`new Camera({ frameEffects: [...] })`) adding
  `vignette` and grain. Support per backend (full matrix in
  `docs/renderers.md`):
  - **CanvasRenderer 2D**: offscreen composite with `ctx.filter` -- glow and
    drop shadow deliberately ride chained CSS `drop-shadow()` filter entries
    rather than the `shadowBlur`/`shadowColor` context properties, because
    `@napi-rs/canvas` (Skia) ignores the shadow properties on `drawImage`
    entirely (verified empirically) while filter `drop-shadow()` behaves
    identically in Skia and browsers. Noise is a deterministic seeded tile,
    alpha-clipped -- byte-identical across runs so the content-hash
    partial-movie cache stays sound.
  - **CanvasRenderer 3D**: frame grading composites post-blit (sidestepping
    `putImageData` ignoring `ctx.filter`); per-mobject effects apply to
    overlay text/images and fixed-in-frame draws (z-buffered solid geometry
    is documented as skipped).
  - **SVGRenderer**: native `<filter>` defs (`feGaussianBlur`,
    `feDropShadow`, `feColorMatrix`/`feComponentTransfer` from shared
    CSS-spec matrices, chained glow, best-effort `feTurbulence` noise),
    mirroring the existing gradient-defs pattern;
    `color-interpolation-filters="sRGB"` keeps results matching canvas.
  - Effects deep-copy through `copy()`, propagate from groups to leaves
    (like zIndex), interpolate through `Transform` for same-shape stacks,
    and animate live via updaters. Node renders get an injectable
    `createCanvas` factory (also making `cacheStatic()` work under Node,
    previously a silent no-op there).

- **GPU post-processing for the WebGL backend**
  (`src/renderer/three_post.ts`): bloom / film grain / glitch / LUT color
  grading / SMAA via three's own bundled EffectComposer passes, plus custom
  user fragment-shader passes (`tDiffuse` provided; `uTime`/`uResolution`
  auto-injected when referenced). Configured with a `postProcessing` option
  on `browser-three`'s `play()`/`record()` and Node's `renderGL()` (where it
  is JSON-serialized into the headless-Chrome harness -- `lut.url`, not
  `lut.texture`, on that path). `OutputPass` (sRGB + tone mapping) is
  deliberately opt-in to preserve the CPU-renderer color parity that
  `ColorManagement.enabled = false` exists for. New
  `examples/post-processing.ts` (bloom + grain + a scanline shader) and a
  docs section with the user-shader contract.

### Fixed
- **`record()` (browser-three) captured ZERO frames whenever a single
  render exceeded the frame budget** -- e.g. post-processing bloom under
  software GL, or any sufficiently heavy scene. The pacing loop
  (`while (now < target) await nextFrame()`) never awaited a single
  requestAnimationFrame when already behind schedule, so the page never
  yielded to the browser's rendering steps, the WebGL canvas never
  PRESENTED, and `captureStream().requestFrame()` had nothing to capture:
  the recording came out as a header-only ~110-byte WebM. Diagnosed by
  reading pixels directly off the canvas in the same task (bloom rendered
  perfectly -- 19,200/19,200 lit pixels -- proving capture, not rendering,
  was broken). Fixed with a do-while (always yield at least one rAF per
  frame). The e2e assertion that let this slip ("output size > 0", which a
  110-byte header passes) is now "> 1000 bytes".
- **`Circle`/`Arc` silently ignored a `point` config key** (issue #37) --
  only `Dot` respected it, while the correct key, `arcCenter`, wasn't
  discoverable, and `MobjectConfig`'s `[key: string]: any` index signature
  means TypeScript never flags the wrong key on any config object. `point`
  is now a real, documented alias for `arcCenter` on the whole `Arc`
  hierarchy (`arcCenter` wins when both are given); `Dot`'s own existing
  `point` handling is unaffected (its post-construction `moveTo` is
  absolute, so the value applying at the Arc level too is idempotent, not
  compounded). The issue's broader suggestion -- narrowing the index
  signature so wrong-key config bugs fail at compile time library-wide --
  is a separate, larger typing change deliberately not attempted here.
- **`ThreeDAxes`' x/y/z axis segments rendered disconnected whenever a
  range didn't include 0** (issue #31), e.g. a log-scale axis over values
  that never reach 0 (`log10(bits)` for a 16-2048 bit range). The
  constructor unconditionally shifted each axis so its data-value-0
  sits at the world origin, regardless of whether 0 actually falls inside
  that axis's own range — for an out-of-range axis, that anchor point
  sits off the visible segment, so the three axes never meet. Fixed by
  adding `_xRef()`/`_yRef()`/`_zRef()` (falling back to the axis's own
  minimum when 0 isn't in `[xMin, xMax]`) and using them — instead of a
  hardcoded `0` — in the constructor's shift and in `coordsToPoint`/
  `pointToCoords`, mirroring the 2D `Axes` class's existing pattern.
  Confirmed via direct repro: the reported case (`xRange: [1.1, 3.4]`,
  `yRange`/`zRange` straddling 0) now has all three axes meeting at one
  shared corner, with `c2p`/`p2c` round-tripping correctly across the
  full range; a normal 0-including range renders byte-identical to
  before.
- **The 2D `Axes` class has the identical bug**, found while fixing the
  above: `_xRef()`/`_yRef()` checked `Number.isFinite(functionOf(0))`,
  which only catches a *true* log-scale axis (`functionOf(0) = -Infinity`)
  — not the far more common case of a plain linear range that simply
  doesn't straddle 0. Confirmed via direct repro before this fix:
  `new Axes({ xRange: [1.1, 3.4, 0.5], ... })` rendered its x-axis
  spanning world x∈[4.07, 12.57], nowhere near the y-axis's crossing at
  world x=0 — the exact "disconnected axes" symptom issue #31 reports
  for the 3D case. Fixed by checking range membership
  (`xMin <= 0 && 0 <= xMax`) instead of function finiteness, same rule
  as the `ThreeDAxes` fix above.

### Added
- **`Circumscribe`/`Flash`/`FocusOn` now support camera-facing billboarding
  for a genuinely-3D (non-fixed) target** (issue #29 — the remaining half
  of issue #21 the 0.0.13 fix explicitly deferred). Pass a 3D camera via
  the new `camera` config option (e.g. `new Circumscribe(worldDot, {
  camera: this.camera })` inside a `ThreeDScene`) to build the highlight
  directly in the target's camera-tangent plane — the two world-space
  directions that project to flat screen X/Y under the current camera
  orientation — instead of a fixed world-XY plane. The ordinary 3D
  pipeline then projects it back out undistorted, still perspective-scaled
  and depth-tested against other 3D content, at any camera angle. The
  basis is recomputed every `interpolateMobject()` frame (not cached at
  construction), so an orbiting camera (`beginAmbientCameraRotation()`,
  `moveCamera()`) is tracked correctly throughout the highlight's runtime.
  Ignored (falls back to issue #21's existing flag-propagation path) when
  the target is already fixed-in-frame/fixed-orientation. Confirmed via
  direct rendered-frame inspection: a `Circumscribe`/`Flash` on a genuine
  3D point under a 65°/-70° camera now renders a proper undistorted square
  and symmetric burst (previously a skewed parallelogram and lopsided
  starburst), including across 4 sampled frames spanning a full ambient
  camera rotation.
- **`Camera`/`ThreeDCamera` gain an opt-in `superSample` option** (issue
  #26) fixing badly aliased 3D-scene rendering: `src/renderer/zbuffer.ts`'s
  `ZBuffer` (used for every non-fixed-in-frame mobject in a `ThreeDScene`)
  did hard, binary per-pixel edge tests with no anti-aliasing at all --
  any `Text` or `VMobject` stroke at real 3D depth rendered with badly
  staircased edges, most damaging on Text glyphs. `ZBuffer` now renders
  internally at `superSample`x linear resolution and box-filters down in
  `blitTo()`; every `triangle()`/`triangleGouraud()`/`line()` call site is
  unchanged (still logical pixel-space coordinates -- the scale-up/down is
  transparent). Default 1 (byte-identical to prior behavior, since this
  costs `O(superSample^2)` more pixel work on a CPU rasterizer); pass
  `new ThreeDCamera({ ..., superSample: 2 })` to opt in. Confirmed fixed
  via direct pixel inspection of a cropped, zoomed rendered frame:
  `superSample: 1` shows the exact staircase-stepped glyph edges reported;
  2x and 3x both show smooth, gray-blended anti-aliased edges.
- **3D mesh import** (`.obj`/`.stl`), two tiers:
  - **`loadMeshOBJ`/`loadMeshSTL`** (`src/loaders/mesh_obj.ts`, `mesh_stl.ts`):
    parse a mesh into a `Polyhedron` (`src/mobject/polyhedra.ts`) — arbitrary
    `(vertexCoords, facesList)` was already supported there, so rotate/scale/
    moveTo/copy all work for free via the same real per-point transform code
    every Mobject uses. Both loaders dedupe coincident vertices (raw parser
    output usually has zero vertex sharing, which would otherwise make every
    triangle a disconnected island) and share that dedup logic via a new
    `src/loaders/mesh_util.ts`. Uses `three`'s own bundled `OBJLoader`/
    `STLLoader` (already an `optionalDependency`) — no new dependency.
    `Polyhedron` gained `showVertices`/`showEdges` config (default `true`,
    unchanged for the existing Platonic solids) so an imported mesh doesn't
    show a vertex-dot/wireframe overlay by default.
  - **`loadMesh3D`/`Mesh3D`** (`src/loaders/mesh3d_loader.ts`,
    `src/mobject/mesh3d.ts`): a GPU-tier alternative for larger meshes.
    Benchmarked: the `Polyhedron` path's per-frame CPU cost degrades sharply
    with triangle count (~600ms just to construct a ~10k-triangle mesh,
    ~76ms/frame to render it — well past a 24fps budget); `Mesh3D` instead
    accumulates transforms into a single 4×4 matrix (applied as the built
    `THREE.Mesh`'s own matrix, cached and reused across frames) rather than
    touching a per-point array, dropping construction to ~2ms regardless of
    size. `ThreeRenderer` gained a `meshes` bucket in `collectBuffers()`
    (`src/renderer/geometry_util.ts`) for this; `CanvasRenderer` has no CPU
    path for it (explicitly skipped, not mis-rasterized as its lightweight
    bounding-box proxy).
  - **Compositor integration**: `examples/compositor/` gained an "Import 3D
    (.obj/.stl)" layer type, following the exact existing Image/Video
    upload/asset-cache pattern — uses the CPU `Polyhedron` tier specifically
    (not `Mesh3D`), since the compositor's live preview only ever renders
    through `CanvasRenderer`, which has no path for the GPU tier by design.
    Fixed along the way: `loadMeshOBJ`/`loadMeshSTL`'s dynamic
    `import("three/examples/jsm/...")` resolves fine under Node (bare
    specifiers resolve via `node_modules`) but not in a plain browser, whose
    native ES module loader can't resolve bare specifiers at all without an
    import map — switched to the `"three/addons/"` alias (three's own
    package.json exports both paths identically) and added the matching
    `<script type="importmap">` to the compositor's `index.html`, mirroring
    `examples/browser-three/index.html`'s existing convention.
  - GLTF import remains a tracked follow-up.

### Fixed
- **The render cache silently reused stale segments when only the
  renderer/camera config changed** (issue #27) -- confirmed via direct
  repro: re-rendering the exact same scene with only `background` changed
  (`#FF0000` to `#0000FF`) produced byte-identical (still-red) output,
  because `Scene.hashAnimations()`'s content hash has no knowledge of
  resolution/background/3D-camera settings, only animation/mobject
  content. Fixed via a new `Scene.computeRenderConfigHash(config)`,
  salted into every partial filename in both `node.ts` and
  `node-parallel.ts` (which share the same salt so their caches stay
  byte-compatible, per the existing documented convention). Covers
  resolution, background, fps, transparency, and (for a 3D camera)
  orientation/zoom/rasterizer settings (including the new `superSample`
  option above) at `render()` call time. Does not cover camera state that
  changes mid-scene (ambient rotation, `moveCamera()`) -- a separate,
  harder problem left alone here. Found while building a test harness to
  verify the `superSample` fix above -- the harness's own before/after
  comparison renders were silently hitting this exact bug.

## 0.0.13

### Added
- **`examples/e2e-feature-tour.ts`**: an end-to-end scene exercising the
  0.0.7-0.0.12 feature surface together through the real public
  `ecmanim`/`ecmanim/node` package — `FlexGroup` layout, HarfBuzz text
  shaping, `spring()`'s `velocity0`, `crossFade`/`springTiming`,
  `SVGMobject` gradient+clipPath, `Code.diffTo()`, and `Scene.track()`/
  `bindTrack()` — rendered to a real MP4 rather than exercised only through
  each feature's own isolated unit tests. Found 4 real issues in the
  process (see this section's other entries plus issues #23 and the
  `Code.diffTo()`/`FlexGroup` doc callouts below).
- `Code.diffTo()`'s doc comment now calls out that tokens present only in
  the target `Code` get added directly to the scene by `Scene.play()` (via
  the underlying `TransformMatchingAuto`'s per-token `FadeIn`s) even though
  the target itself was never explicitly added — so cleanup after a diff
  needs to fade out both the source and target `Code` instances, not just
  the source.
- **`sampleSceneAt(sceneOrConstruct, targetTime, config?)`** (`src/scene/orchestrate.ts`):
  replays a Scene's `construct()` from the start and stops as soon as the
  scene's own simulated clock reaches `targetTime`, returning the driven
  Scene so its mobjects reflect the interpolated state at that moment — the
  primitive that lets a Scene's animation be scrubbed or embedded elsewhere
  (e.g. a compositing tool) without a full render. `isSceneLike`/`makeScene`/
  `runConstruct` (the shared Scene-vs-bare-construct-function handling
  already used internally by every backend) are now exported alongside it.
- **`glyphsFromDomSvg(svgElement, config?)`** (`src/mobject/mathtex.ts`):
  builds MathTex glyph VMobjects directly from a real browser `<svg>`
  Element, via a small `domAdaptor` shim over mathjax-full's internal
  glyph-collection logic. Lets `MathTex` work with CDN-loaded MathJax's
  `tex2svg()` (real DOM output) in addition to the existing Node/lite-adaptor
  path, so vector MathTex now renders correctly in-browser.
- **ecmanim Compositor** (`examples/compositor/`): a browser-based visual
  scene-compositing/animation editor — layers/canvas/inspector/timeline
  editing, onion skinning, keyboard transport shortcuts, a Scene Settings
  panel (duration/fps/aspect/background), keyframe snapping to the frame
  grid, an independent play-range/loop marker, undo/redo, and an "export to
  ecmanim source" generator. Supports Circle/Square/Rectangle/Ellipse/Dot/
  Line/Arrow/Star/Polygon/Text/MathTex/Graph/Code/Scene/Sound layers, with
  universal animatable Rotation/Scale on every layer type. A Graph layer's
  expression can be driven by an animatable `k` variable and can cross-fade
  (tween) between two expressions' sampled curves. Serve via
  `node --experimental-strip-types examples/compositor/serve.ts`.
- **`examples/studio-demo/`**: a runnable Studio dev-server example
  (`FunctionExplorerScene`) demonstrating `defineSchema`/props, named camera
  stops, and a property-keyframe track driving a live marker pulse.

### Fixed
- **`FlexGroup`'s `flexGrow`/`flexShrink` now actually resize the child**
  (issue #23), matching real CSS Flexbox instead of only repositioning it
  within Yoga's computed box. `layout()` resizes a flex child on the MAIN
  axis only (width for `row`/`row-reverse`, height for `column`/
  `column-reverse`, via `setWidth`/`setHeight`'s axis-only `stretch: true`)
  when it has `flexGrow` or `flexShrink` configured; a child with neither
  keeps its own authored size exactly as before. Confirmed via direct
  repro: a `flexGrow: 1` child's `getWidth()` was previously unchanged
  (still its original size) after `layout()` despite being correctly
  repositioned as if it already filled the larger box Yoga computed for
  it — now it's actually resized to fill that box.
- **`Circumscribe`/`Flash`/`FocusOn` render skewed under a 3D camera, even
  targeting an already-fixed-in-frame mobject** (issue #21). Each builds a
  brand-new, flat highlight mobject (a `Rectangle`/ring of `Line`s/`Circle`)
  rather than reusing the target, so it never inherited the target's
  `_fixedInFrame`/`_fixedOrientation` flags (set by
  `addFixedInFrameMobjects()`/`addFixedOrientedMobjects()`) — even when the
  target itself was correctly flagged. Fixed by propagating both flags from
  the target: automatic for `Circumscribe` (always given a real target
  Mobject) and for `Flash`/`FocusOn` when called with a Mobject rather than
  a raw point (both now also accept a Mobject directly, extracting its
  center the same way `FocusOn` already did); a new `fixedInFrame`/
  `fixedOrientation` config option is the fallback for a raw point with
  nothing to inherit from. This fixes the "target already fixed-in-frame"
  case from the issue; the separate genuinely-3D-target skew (a receded
  world-space point under camera rotation) is unaffected — that needs
  camera-facing billboarding, a larger follow-up left for a future issue.
- **Every glyph shaped via the optional HarfBuzz text-shaping backend
  rendered upside down.** `shapeWithHarfBuzz()`
  (`src/mobject/text_shaping_hb.ts`) passed the same `flipY: true` to
  `subpathsToVMobject()` that the opentype.js-based path uses, but the two
  libraries emit glyph outlines in opposite Y conventions: confirmed
  directly for the same font/glyph ("H"), opentype.js's
  `glyph.getPath().toPathData()` emits Y-DOWN pixel-space coordinates (top
  of "H" at y=-71.6), while HarfBuzz's `glyphToPath()` emits Y-UP
  font-unit-space coordinates (top of "H" at y=+71.58) for the identical
  glyph. `flipY: true` correctly un-inverts the former into this codebase's
  Y-up world space; applied to the latter, it double-flips an already
  right-side-up path. Fixed by using `flipY: false` for the HarfBuzz path.
  Found by actually rendering a scene with `setTextShapingBackend("harfbuzz")`
  active and looking at the output — every existing HarfBuzz test asserts
  on glyph counts/widths, never orientation, so this was invisible to the
  test suite despite 6/6 of those tests passing throughout.
- **`SVGMobject`'s `<linearGradient>` fill was silently dropped whenever
  the same element also had a `clip-path`** — an untested combination
  (existing gradient and clip-path tests each cover their feature in
  isolation). `applyClipPath()` wraps a clipped shape in an `Intersection`
  (`src/mobject/boolean_ops.ts`), whose shared `copyStyle()` helper (also
  used by `Union`/`Difference`/`Exclusion`) only copied
  `fillColor`/`fillOpacity`/`strokeColor`/`strokeWidth`/`strokeOpacity` —
  never `gradientColors`/`sheenDirection` — so a gradient-filled, clipped
  shape silently fell back to a flat fill (the gradient's own first stop,
  already stashed in `fillColor` as a fallback) instead of rendering an
  actual gradient. `copyStyle()` now also copies `gradientColors` (when
  present) and `sheenDirection`, fixing every boolean op, not just SVG
  clipping. Found while rendering an SVG badge combining both features
  (added in the same 0.0.11 release) in one end-to-end scene.
- **`setTextShapingBackend()` and the rest of the optional HarfBuzz
  text-shaping API were never wired into the public `ecmanim`/`ecmanim/node`
  barrels** — `import { setTextShapingBackend } from "ecmanim"` threw "does
  not provide an export," making the entire 0.0.11 HarfBuzz feature
  unreachable outside a deep import of `src/mobject/text_shaping.ts`. The
  feature itself was correctly implemented and unit-tested against its own
  module the whole time; this is the same class of gap the 0.0.12 release
  notes describe catching for `linearTiming`/`springTiming`/
  `registerStylePreset`, just missed for this one. `setTextShapingBackend`,
  `getTextShapingBackend`, `isTextShapingBackendActive`, `buildGlyphRun`,
  and `measureGlyphRunWidth` (plus their types) are now exported from
  `src/index.ts`. Found while building an end-to-end scene that actually
  opts into HarfBuzz shaping via the public package rather than a source
  import.
- Three `test/text-shaping-harfbuzz.test.ts` ligature tests assumed
  DejaVu-Sans-specific coverage ("ffi"/"office" merging into a ligature
  glyph). On macOS, `resolveFontPath()` commonly resolves to the system
  Arial build, which has a `liga` GSUB feature but no "ffi"/"fi"/"fl"/"ff"
  substitutions in it — HarfBuzz shaping was genuinely active
  (`canShapeWithHarfBuzz: true`, backend reports `"harfbuzz"`), the font
  itself just doesn't define those ligatures. The tests now check whether
  the loaded font actually merges the glyphs before asserting, skipping
  gracefully (matching the file's existing "degrade don't fail" style)
  when it doesn't, instead of failing on environments with a different
  system font.
- **`attachKeyframeTimelineEditor`'s drag lost tracking when the pointer left
  the canvas mid-drag** (`src/studio/timeline.ts`) — rows are ~20px tall, so
  a horizontal drag very easily overshoots the canvas's vertical bounds.
  Now captures the pointer on drag start (`setPointerCapture`) so
  move/up keep targeting the canvas even outside its box, and no longer ends
  the drag on `pointerleave`.

## 0.0.12

### Fixed
- **`startStudio()` was hardcoded to bind only to `127.0.0.1`, with no way to
  configure it** — unreachable from any device other than the one running
  the dev server, which reads exactly like a firewall problem (connection
  refused, not filtered) if you're viewing from another machine on the LAN
  or over a remote/SSH-tunneled session. Added a `host` option (still
  defaults to `127.0.0.1` — this dev server has no auth); passing
  `host: "0.0.0.0"` binds wide-open. `StudioHandle` gained `urls: string[]`,
  every address the server is actually reachable at (loopback + every
  discovered LAN address when wildcard-bound), since a literal
  `http://0.0.0.0:PORT/` URL isn't reliably browsable as-is.

## 0.0.11

### Added
- **Page-transition playback resume** (`ecmanim/browser`):
  `enablePageTransitionResume(playerEl, opts?)` carries a `<manim-player>`'s
  playback position across a full page navigation — saves `{ time }` to
  `sessionStorage` on `pagehide`, restores it via `seekTime()` once the new
  page's player fires "ready". `savePlaybackPosition()`/
  `restorePlaybackPosition()` are the underlying pure functions if you want
  to wire your own lifecycle hooks. Opt-in `{ viewTransition: true }`
  additionally does a View Transitions snapshot handoff (canvases don't
  participate in the browser's DOM-snapshot mechanism directly, so this
  captures the outgoing frame into a plain `<img>` tagged with a shared
  `view-transition-name`, and tags the incoming canvas with the same name).
- **`FlexGroup`** (`src/mobject/flex_group.ts`): opt-in real Flexbox layout
  via [Yoga](https://www.yogalayout.dev/) (Meta/React's portable WASM
  Flexbox engine), a new `optionalDependency` (`yoga-layout`) mirroring
  `@napi-rs/canvas`/`three`/`harfbuzzjs`'s graceful-degrade pattern.
  `direction`/`justifyContent`/`alignItems`/`gap` at the container level;
  `flexGrow`/`flexShrink`/`flexBasis`/`margin` per child via
  `setChildFlex()`. `await group.layout()` builds a fresh Yoga node tree
  from the group's current children and repositions them — necessarily
  async (Yoga's WASM must load first), documented prominently as the one
  sharp edge in `docs/flex-group.md`. Fully additive: mobjects outside a
  `FlexGroup` are unaffected, and a child can still pin its own size.
- **WebGL raster-text batching** (`ThreeRenderer`): raster `Text`
  (`RasterText`) mobjects now render as ONE shared texture atlas + ONE
  merged quad mesh instead of one `THREE.Sprite` (own `CanvasTexture`) per
  mobject — converts N draw calls into 1. New `src/renderer/text_atlas.ts`'s
  `buildTextAtlas()` does simple shelf-packing (sort tallest-first, pack
  into rows). Scoped to a 2D-orthographic camera, where a flat quad is
  visually identical to a billboarded sprite (the camera always looks
  straight down -Z); a genuine 3D/perspective camera keeps the original
  per-sprite path so real per-mobject billboarding still works. Falls back
  to the per-sprite path gracefully wherever no synchronous canvas/document
  backend is available (e.g. headless Node), same as the pre-existing
  per-sprite code already did.
- **`Mobject.cacheStatic()`** + `CanvasRenderer` static-subtree render cache:
  an opt-in marker that, on an unchanged frame (content-based fingerprint
  of geometry/style AND camera state — NOT reference equality, since
  `interpolate()` mutates `points` element-by-element while keeping the
  same outer array reference), blits a small cached offscreen bitmap
  instead of re-walking the mobject's bezier path. Screen-space, MVP-scoped:
  invalidated on any camera-state change, so it mainly helps static-camera
  scenes with many unchanging elements (dense axis labels, background
  grids), not continuous camera motion. Requires a synchronous
  offscreen-canvas backend (`OffscreenCanvas` or a detached `<canvas>`
  element) — gracefully no-ops (draws directly, same as always) under
  Node/no-DOM, where only an async `@napi-rs/canvas` import is available.
- **Property-keyframe Studio timeline**: `Scene.track(keyframes)` (mirrors
  `addSound()`'s ergonomic) creates a `PlayableKeyframeTrack`
  (`src/reactive/keyframes.ts`) — Cluster 2's `KeyframeTrack` plus
  absolute-time `tick(dt)`/`seek(t)`, kept in exact agreement so authoring
  playback and a Studio scrub can never drift apart. `bindTrack(mobject,
  prop, track)` wires a track's value onto a mobject property via the
  ordinary updater mechanism — zero `Scene`/render changes needed for
  playback correctness. `scene.keyframeTracks` mirrors the existing
  `sections`/`sounds` array pattern. New `computeKeyframeMarkers()`/
  `renderKeyframeTimeline()`/`attachKeyframeTimelineEditor()`
  (`src/studio/timeline.ts`) draw a draggable per-track keyframe strip;
  dragging updates a keyframe's time (keeping keyframes sorted), and a
  debounced `onCommit` hook is meant to call item 7's parameter-only
  re-render primitive (`player.rerender()`) to rebake frames, since
  `Player.frames[]` are frozen bitmaps that a drag alone can't affect.
- **Rendered props panel** (`startStudio({ props: true })`): draws one
  control per `schemaToControls()` descriptor, pre-filled from the schema's
  own defaults. Edits are debounced (80ms) and re-render via
  `<manim-player>.rerender(props)` → `Player.record(scene, { props })`
  (parameter-only re-render, no re-`import()`), validated through
  `schema.safeParse()` first. A real file-save reload still does a full
  `load()` + panel reset; the two triggers are kept structurally separate
  (a rerender-triggered "ready" event carries the same schema object, so it
  doesn't reset the panel).
- **Waveform visualization** (`startStudio({ waveform: true })`): draws a
  bar-chart waveform strip below the live preview for each of the scene's
  `addSound()`-scheduled sounds, positioned on the shared timeline via
  `src/studio/timeline.ts`'s new `computeWaveformBars()`/`renderWaveform()`.
  Reuses the existing `getAudioData()`/`getWaveformPortion()` audio
  primitives (both Node ffmpeg and browser AudioContext backends) — no new
  audio decoding. Opt-in; off by default.
- **Parameter-only re-render primitive**: `runConstruct(sceneOrConstruct,
  scene, props?)` and `Player.record(sceneOrConstruct, { props? })` thread
  `props` through to a Scene subclass's own `config.props` or a bare
  construct function's 2nd argument — both additive/opt-in. This still
  re-runs `construct()` and re-records every frame; it doesn't itself avoid
  that cost.
- **`Player` step navigation**: `steps()`/`stepContaining()`/`seekToStep()`/
  `nextStep()`/`prevStep()`, mirroring the existing section-navigation
  methods but reading `scene.playRecords` (finer-grained, independent of
  section boundaries). `<manim-player>`'s presenter keydown handler now has
  two tiers: plain Right/Left step; Shift+Right/Left (or PageDown/PageUp)
  jump whole sections.
- **`Scene.nextSection()` gains an optional `notes` parameter** (and
  `SceneSection.notes`) for presenter-mode speaker notes.
- **`Player.drawFrameTo(ctx, frameIndex, opts?)`**: draws an arbitrary
  recorded frame to an arbitrary ctx/position/size — "nearly free" since
  frames are already rasterized bitmaps. `seek()` now uses this internally;
  it's also the primitive behind section-overview thumbnails.
- **`src/studio/timeline.ts`**: shared time/frame↔pixel mapping
  (`timeToPixel`/`pixelToTime`/`frameToPixel`/`pixelToFrame`) plus
  `computeSectionThumbnails()`/`renderSectionOverview()` (a jump-to-section
  overview strip) and `computeStepMarkers()`. Each render function has a
  DOM-free "compute layout" half, independently unit-testable.
- **`MovingCameraScene.defineCameraStop(name, stop)` /
  `goToCameraStop(name, config?)`**: named camera viewpoints
  (center/width/height/zoom), sugar over `camera.frame.animate.moveTo()/
  setWidth()/setHeight()`, applied as a single composed animation (not one
  per field, which would otherwise race to overwrite the frame mobject's
  points each tick). `zoom` scales the frame's own width/height — documented
  as a distinct concept from the interactive camera's `camera.zoom`
  multiplier.
- **`copyMemberwiseStyle(dest, src, extraExclude?)`** (`src/mobject/copy_style.ts`):
  a shared denylist-based memberwise style copy, extracted from
  `Mobject.become()`. Now also used by `alwaysRedraw()` and `reactive()`'s
  rebuild step, in place of their own independently-hardcoded allowlists —
  any current or future custom field on a `Mobject` subclass now redraws
  correctly through all three paths, not just the fields each one happened
  to enumerate.
- **`KeyframeTrack<T>` / `PlayKeyframeTrack` / `animateSignal()`**
  (`src/animation/keyframe_track.ts`): a unified keyframe-track primitive
  that, unlike every other easing tool here, keeps its structured, mutable
  keyframe list around for introspection/editing (a Studio scrub UI can
  splice keyframes directly; `valueAt(t)` reflects it immediately).
  Per-keyframe `ease` (a `RateFunc` or a string resolved via `running()`)
  eases the transition arriving at that keyframe. Default interpolation
  handles `number`/`number[]` via `V.lerp`; `options.interpolate` is the
  escape hatch for other types (e.g. `Color.lerp` for a color track).
  `PlayKeyframeTrack` is an `Animation` for `scene.play()`-driven use
  (explicit `config.runTime` wins over the track's own duration, same
  precedence as `transitions.ts`'s `springTiming()`); `.valueAt(t)` is also
  usable directly inside a plain `addUpdater`. `animateSignal(signal, track)`
  points a `PlayKeyframeTrack` at a signal's setter, giving "a signal driven
  by a keyframe timeline" with no separate mechanism.
- **`SceneRenderer` interface + `renderFrame()`** (`src/renderer/scene_renderer.ts`):
  `CanvasRenderer`, `ThreeRenderer`, and `SVGRenderer` each gain an additive
  `renderFrame(mobjects)` method that purely delegates to their existing,
  differently-named public method (`renderScene`/`render`/`renderToString`
  respectively). Those existing methods are unchanged and remain the
  primary API (used across 15+ call sites) — `renderFrame()` is a shared,
  uniform entry point for code that wants to treat any backend
  interchangeably, not a replacement or rename.
- **`reprojectCurve(domainSamples | curve, targetSystem, options?)`**
  (`src/mobject/coordinate_reprojection.ts`): rebuilds a curve sampled in
  domain (coordinate) space against a different coordinate system (e.g. an
  `Axes`-plotted curve reprojected onto a `PolarPlane`), reusing the same
  `setPointsAsCorners` construction `Axes.plot()` uses so fidelity matches a
  curve plotted directly against the target. `targetSystem` is typed
  structurally (`{ coordsToPoint(a, b) }`), so `Axes`/`PolarPlane`/
  `ComplexPlane` all work as either source or target. `Axes.plot()` now
  stamps a hidden `_domainSamples` tag on its result so
  `reprojectCurve(curve, targetSystem)` can read the samples back
  automatically instead of requiring the caller to re-supply them.
- **`SpringParams.velocity0`**: the analytic spring (`src/animation/spring.ts`)
  now accepts a nonzero initial velocity (default 0, byte-identical to the
  prior zero-initial-velocity formula in every damping regime). Enables
  "fling and decelerate" momentum — spring a value back toward *itself*
  (`from === to`) seeded with a release velocity, instead of the usual
  "seek a fixed target from rest".
- **Studio drag momentum** (`src/studio/interactive.ts`):
  `attachInteractiveCamera(..., { momentum: true })` continues panning (2D)
  or orbiting (3D) after a drag release, decelerating via a spring seeded
  with the release velocity (from a short ring buffer of recent pointer
  samples). Opt-in via `momentum`, tunable via `momentumConfig`; a fresh
  drag cancels any in-flight momentum. `now`/`scheduleFrame`/`cancelFrame`
  are injectable (default `Date.now`/`requestAnimationFrame`) for
  deterministic testing.
- **`Repeat`** (`src/animation/repeat.ts`): a standalone `Animation` wrapper
  adding `count`/`yoyo`/`repeatDelay` to any leaf `Animation`, `AnimationGroup`,
  or built `Timeline`, without reaching into their internals. `yoyo` mirrors
  odd-indexed cycles; `repeatDelay` holds the previous cycle's end value
  between cycles. Infinite repeat is out of scope (no infinite-time concept
  in this render model); `count: Infinity` throws.
- **Stagger value-transform helpers** (`src/animation/stagger.ts`):
  `cycle(values)` (index-safe modulo cycling) and `staggerRange(from, to)`
  (linear distribution by index), usable with `LaggedStartMap`'s widened
  `(mobject, index, total)` factory signature (previously `(mobject)` only —
  backward compatible, existing single-arg factories are unaffected).
- **`Scene.autoAnimateToNextSection(name, buildNext, config?)`**: an opt-in
  Reveal.js Auto-Animate-style section transition. Snapshots the scene, lets
  `buildNext()` mutate `this.mobjects` into the next section's state (moves,
  additions, removals), then plays a `TransformMatchingAuto` between the two
  states instead of a hard cut — landing on the true original mobjects
  afterward so identity is preserved for later code. Strictly opt-in; plain
  `nextSection()` is unaffected.
- **`VMobject.alignPointsWith()` now searches for the best cyclic subpath
  rotation** between the two shapes' subpath orders (by total centroid-to-
  centroid distance) before aligning, so a compound shape whose subpaths were
  authored/traversed in a different order (but represent the same elements)
  still matches subpath-for-subpath by position. Capped at 32 subpaths
  (falls back to identity order above that); zero-cost no-op for the
  dominant single-subpath case.
- **Parameterized back/elastic easings**: `easeInBackFactory`/`easeOutBackFactory`/
  `easeInOutBackFactory(overshoot?)` and `easeInElasticFactory`/`easeOutElasticFactory`/
  `easeInOutElasticFactory(amplitude?, period?)` (GSAP's `back.out(2)`/
  `elastic.out(1, 0.3)` ergonomic), byte-identical to the existing plain
  exports at default args. Registered as `"backIn"/"backOut"/"backInOut"` and
  `"elasticIn"/"elasticOut"/"elasticInOut"` rate-function factories, so
  `running("backOut:2")` / `running("elasticOut:1,0.3")` resolve them by name.
- **Unified rate-function registry**: `running()` now checks
  `registry.rateFunctions`/`registry.rateFunctionFactories` *before* the
  built-in `RATE_FUNCTIONS` map, so a plugin can override a built-in name by
  registering under the same key. Added colon-parameterized name parsing
  (`"name:arg1,arg2"`) dispatching to a registered factory. `"spring"`
  (an fps=60 convenience default; use `springRate(config, scene.fps)` directly
  for frame-accurate springs) and a `"bezier:x1,y1,x2,y2"` factory
  (wrapping `Easing.bezier`) are now registered built-ins.
- **`TransitionConfig.timing`**: a `TimingPreset` (`linearTiming(rateFunc?)` /
  `springTiming(config?, durationInFrames?)`) supplying `crossFade`/`slide`/
  `wipe`'s shared `rateFunc` and, optionally, a suggested `runTime` — explicit
  `config.runTime` always wins over a preset's computed duration.
  `springTiming()` measures its own natural settle time via `measureSpring()`
  unless `durationInFrames` is given explicitly.
- **Style-preset registration API**: `registry.stylePresets` +
  `registerStylePreset(name, preset)`, checked by `resolveStyle()` alongside
  the built-in `STYLE_PRESETS` map — the same plugin-registry pattern already
  used for colors/rate-functions/mobjects.
- **Word-wrap for `Text`**: a new `width` config option greedily wraps long
  lines to fit, using real glyph-advance measurement when a vector font is
  loaded or the `CHAR_ASPECT` estimate otherwise. `estimateTextSize()` gained
  a matching `opts.width` parameter.
- **Optional HarfBuzz text-shaping backend** (`setTextShapingBackend("harfbuzz")`,
  opt-in, default remains `"opentype"`): real GSUB/GPOS shaping via the
  `harfbuzzjs` WASM build — actual ligatures, combining-mark composition, and
  correct kerning/positioning — instead of the previous naive per-character
  `charToGlyph` loop. `disableLigatures` (previously a dead config field) now
  has real effect when this backend is active. Falls back to the `"opentype"`
  backend transparently if HarfBuzz can't load or a font has no raw bytes
  available to build an `hb.Font` from.
- **`Code.diffTo(other)`**: morphs one `Code` snapshot's tokens into another's
  via `TransformMatchingAuto` (the Reveal.js Auto-Animate / animated-code-diff
  idea), disambiguating repeated identical tokens on one line via a seeded
  `matchId`.
- **SVG `<linearGradient>` fill and rect/circle `<clipPath>` support** in
  `SVGMobject`, plus matching gradient-export support in the SVG renderer.

### Fixed
- **`linearTiming`/`springTiming`/`registerStylePreset` are now actually
  exported from the public `ecmanim` package** — implemented earlier in this
  release but never wired into `src/index.ts`'s barrel, so they were
  unreachable from `import { ... } from "ecmanim"` despite being documented
  as part of this release. Caught during a pre-release documentation audit
  (every code sample in the docs above was executed against the real
  package to confirm it, which is how these two were found).
- **`Scene.play(animation, config)` no longer requires an undocumented
  internal `_playConfig: true` marker on the config object** (GitHub issue
  #19). Previously, a bare trailing config object like `{ runTime: 0.5 }`
  — exactly the natural way to call `play()`, and how every one of this
  codebase's OWN call sites did it, just always remembering the marker —
  was silently treated as an animation instead of config if that marker
  was missing, crashing with `"a.begin is not a function"` (or, depending
  on what else was in the call, misbehaving in ways that looked like
  corrupted opacity/positioning on a large `VGroup`/vector-field `FadeIn`).
  `play()` now also recognizes config structurally: a trailing plain
  object with neither `.begin` (Animation-shaped) nor `_isAnimateBuilder`
  can only ever have been config, since anything else in that shape was
  already guaranteed to crash — so this is strictly safer and fully
  backward compatible with the existing marker.
- **`alwaysRedraw()` was missing `"radius"` from its own hardcoded 7-field
  allowlist** (`reactive()`'s separate 9-field allowlist had it) — a
  `ValueTracker`-driven `alwaysRedraw(() => new Circle({ radius: r() }))`
  could silently stop reflecting radius changes depending on which of the
  two rebuild paths built it. Both now use `copyMemberwiseStyle()`.
- **`Mobject.become()` no longer copies `updatingSuspended` from its
  source** — previously it could silently un-suspend a mid-animation
  mobject.
- **`SVGMobject` no longer renders `<defs>`/`<clipPath>`/`<linearGradient>`
  contents as visible shapes** — these definition-only containers were
  previously not excluded from the render walk.
- **Kerning**: `vectorized_text.ts`'s glyph-advance loop now calls
  opentype.js's `font.getKerningValue()`, previously available but unused.
- **Grapheme-cluster-aware glyph iteration**: combining-mark sequences (e.g.
  `"e" + U+0301`) and multi-codepoint emoji now build as a single glyph
  slot instead of silently dropping the combining mark's own outline.
- `Text.ts` and `vectorized_text.ts`'s previously-independent, near-identical
  glyph-building loops are now one shared implementation
  (`src/mobject/text_shaping.ts`).

## 0.0.10

### Fixed
- **Node: `Text`/`estimateTextSize()` now auto-load a system font lazily on
  first use, instead of silently falling back to the raster/`CHAR_ASPECT`
  estimate until an explicit `loadVectorFont()` call** (issue #16). Follow-up
  to 0.0.9's fix for #14: exporting `loadVectorFont()` gave callers a way to
  force real glyph metrics, but it was still opt-in, and the raster estimate
  treats every character as equal width — measured against real glyph
  metrics, the two paths could disagree by anywhere from 0.53x to 2.4x
  depending on the string's character composition (not the fixed ~10% a
  single test case had suggested). `getDefaultFont()` now resolves a system
  font via fontconfig the first time it's needed (memoized, at most once per
  process, via a Node-only registration seam so the shared
  `vectorized_text.ts` module stays browser-safe), so a fresh process
  measures text the same way `render()` does without requiring any explicit
  setup call. `loadVectorFont()`/`resolveFontPath()` remain available (now
  alongside a synchronous `loadVectorFontSync()`) for callers who want to
  choose a non-default font pattern or force the fc-match/parse cost eagerly.

## 0.0.9

### Fixed
- **`loadVectorFont`/`resolveFontPath` (Node) are now exported from
  `ecmanim`/`ecmanim/node`, not just the internal `renderer/fonts-node.ts`
  module** (issue #14). Without a public way to force the vector-glyph font
  path `render()` uses internally, `Text`/`estimateTextSize()` measured
  *before* the first `render()` call in a process silently used the
  raster/`CHAR_ASPECT` estimate instead, which could disagree with the real
  glyph metrics `render()` ends up using by ~10% — enough to turn a
  correctly-gated "measure before you render" layout check into clipped
  output. Callers doing their own layout/measurement ahead of `render()` can
  now call `await loadVectorFont()` first to get consistent measurements.

## 0.0.8

### Changed
- **`skills/ecmanim-practical-authoring`: removed the "Confirmed library
  gotchas" section documenting issues #3, #5, and #7** now that all three are
  fixed and published (0.0.7) — the section's write-ups and workarounds were
  stale as soon as they landed. Replaced with a short "Reporting a new bug"
  pointer to `assets/bug_report_template.md`.

## 0.0.7

### Fixed
- **`FadeIn` (and other single-mobject `Animation` subclasses) silently
  duck-typed an extra positional `Mobject` argument as `config`, corrupting
  the first mobject instead of raising an error.** `new FadeIn(a, b)` bound
  `b` (a live `Mobject`) to the `config` parameter; `config.shift` resolved
  to `Mobject.prototype.shift` (a function, so truthy), so `this.shiftVec`
  ended up holding a function instead of a 3-vector, NaN-poisoning `a`'s
  start geometry with no error of any kind. The `Animation` base constructor
  now throws a `TypeError` when its `config` argument is mobject-shaped
  (checked via `points`/`submobjects`/`opacity` own-fields, since most
  subclasses pass `config` through a `{ ...config }` spread before it
  reaches the base, which strips prototype methods but not these own
  fields). Multiple mobjects must be wrapped in a `Group`:
  `new FadeIn(new Group(a, b, c))`.
- **`Mobject.color` was a dead field for rendering purposes.** Raw assignment
  (`mob.color = "#E8833A"`) never synced `VMobject`'s `strokeColor`/
  `fillColor`, which the renderer actually reads, so it silently did nothing
  visible. `color` is now a getter/setter backed by `_color`; the setter
  forwards to `setColor()` so raw assignment and `setColor()` agree. Every
  `setColor()` override (`Mobject`, `VMobject`, `Text` x2) and internal
  copy/interpolate path (`become()`, `copy()`, `interpolate()`) writes to
  `_color` directly to avoid re-entering the setter and recoloring stale or
  shared submobjects.
- **CLI `render`/`plan` crashed with `TypeError: Class constructor ... cannot
  be invoked without 'new'` for scene files that imported `Scene` through a
  different specifier than the CLI itself** (e.g. `import { Scene } from
  "ecmanim/node"`, which resolves to `dist/`, while the CLI's own dev-mode
  `instanceof Scene` check imported `../src/node.ts` directly). Node loaded
  two referentially-distinct copies of `Scene`, so `instanceof` failed even
  for a legitimate subclass and the CLI misidentified it as a bare construct
  function. Replaced every `instanceof Scene` check (CLI scene discovery,
  `makeScene`/`runConstruct`) with a shared duck-typed `isSceneLike()` that
  checks for `construct`/`play`/`wait` on the prototype instead.
- **`Mobject` wasn't iterable.** `for (const m of group)` / `[...group]`
  threw "not iterable" for every `Mobject`/`VGroup`, even though Python
  manim's `VGroup.__iter__` (shallow, over direct submobjects) is a common
  idiom real scripts rely on. Added `[Symbol.iterator]()` delegating to
  `submobjects`.
- **`py2ts`: raw strings (`r"..."`) passed through with the invalid `r`
  prefix intact** (a syntax error) — very common for LaTeX in `MathTex`/`Tex`,
  which almost always use raw strings to avoid backslash-escaping. Now drops
  the prefix and escapes backslashes, preserving raw-string semantics.
- **`py2ts`: `enumerate()` wasn't converted** — `for i, x in enumerate(y):`
  produced a call to a nonexistent `enumerate` function (a `ReferenceError`
  at runtime). Now emits a small generator helper, the same way `range()`
  already does.
- **`py2ts`: top-level (non-method) `def`s were missing the `function`
  keyword** — valid only as class-method shorthand, a syntax error at module
  scope — and even when that's fixed, callers still need the definition's
  camelCased name to match: a bare call to a user-defined snake_case helper
  now gets camelCased at the call site too, consistently with the
  definition.
- `py2ts`'s header comment now names its two known-broken constructs (list/
  generator comprehensions and multi-line statements — both pass through as
  invalid TS silently, not caught by the "TODO marker" safety net the
  header otherwise promises) instead of just claiming a vague "~80% subset."

Found while building real execution-based tests for the four fixes above
(actually running converted output, not just pattern-matching the generated
text — which is exactly what caught these):
- **`py2ts` never `export`ed the converted top-level class.** The CLI
  (`ecmanim render`/`plan`) discovers scenes by inspecting the imported
  module's own exports; an unexported class is invisible to it, so
  `ecmanim render <converted-file>` silently rendered **nothing at all** —
  no error, no video, just a "no exported Scene found" warning. Every
  single file `py2ts` had ever converted was unusable via the CLI.
- **`py2ts`: `self.attr = value` assignments never rewrote the
  assignment's left-hand side.** `rewriteStatement` (which does the
  `self.` → `this.` rewrite) only ever ran on the right-hand side of an
  `=`, so `self.circle = Circle()` produced literal, undefined-at-runtime
  `self.circle = ...` — silently broken for what's likely the single most
  common Python-manim idiom for keeping a mobject reference across a
  scene.
- **`py2ts`: `.append(x)` wasn't converted to `.push(x)`** — passed
  through as syntactically valid but nonexistent-at-runtime JS.
- **`VMobject.setFill()`/`setStroke()` silently accepted the wrong
  argument shape.** Python's `set_fill(color, opacity=0.3)` naturally
  supports keyword args; `py2ts` folds them into a trailing config object
  like it does everywhere else (`setFill(RED, { opacity: 0.3 })`) — but
  the actual signature took a bare number, so `fillOpacity` silently
  became the *object* `{opacity: 0.3}`, not `0.3`. No error, no crash —
  just a wrong value once rendered. Both methods now also accept a
  trailing options object, matching the config-object convention the rest
  of the API already uses.

### Added
- **`CHAR_ASPECT` and `estimateTextSize(text, fontSize, opts?)` exported**
  from `ecmanim`/`ecmanim/node` (`src/mobject/text/Text.ts`). `CHAR_ASPECT`
  (the per-character width factor `RasterText`/`Text` use to size themselves
  before real glyph layout is available) was previously an unexported
  module-private constant — any code that wanted a fast width/height
  estimate without constructing a mobject had to hardcode a duplicate `0.55`
  and hope it never silently drifted from the real one. `RasterText._buildBox()`
  and `Text._buildRasterBox()` (which previously each inlined a slightly
  different copy of the same formula — one hard-coded a `1.2` line height,
  the other used the instance's own `lineSpacing`) now both call this one
  shared, exported function, so there's exactly one formula, used
  identically inside and outside the library. Pure refactor: verified
  byte-identical output for both call sites before and after.
- **`skills/ecmanim-practical-authoring`** — a field guide synthesized from
  real scene-authoring work: frame-geometry/layout math (verified against
  `src/core/constants.ts`), a measured-not-estimated text-width helper, an
  `Axes`-centering helper (`solveAxesShift`), a verification discipline
  (pixel-level clip checks, multi-frame sampling, minimal-repro debugging),
  and confirmed library gotchas with workarounds — including two bug
  reports that turned out to still be open despite being cited as fixed,
  independently re-verified while writing this skill. Includes
  `assets/layout.ts` (a working, runtime-verified helper module) and
  `assets/bug_report_template.md` (modeled on this repo's own best real
  bug reports, issues #1-#3).
  - `assets/layout.ts` gained `solveAxesShift(axes, { left/right/bottom/top })`
    (pin a specific axes-box edge at an exact world-space margin, in
    addition to the existing auto-center form), `assertGap()` (clearance
    between two elements, distinct from `assertClear()`'s frame-boundary
    check), and `buildStatBlock()` for a live-updating label + numeric-value
    row — built on `DecimalNumber`'s `edgeToFix` option (verified against
    `src/mobject/value_tracker.ts`), which keeps a pinned edge stationary
    across `setValue()` regardless of digit-count changes, rather than
    pre-computing a "worst-case width" externally.

## 0.0.6

### Added
- **Pointer-driven interactive camera + `<manim-chart>`** — browser-interactive
  graphing, requested after the mpld3 comparison. New `ecmanim/studio` exports:
  `attachInteractiveCamera(canvas, camera, opts)` attaches drag-to-pan/orbit and
  wheel-to-zoom to any `Camera` (2D `CanvasRenderer`, 2D-orthographic or 3D
  `ThreeRenderer`), plus `onClick`/`onHover` screen-space bounding-box picking
  via the new `pickAt()`. The base `Camera` gained a `zoom` field (default
  no-op), unifying zoom across all three renderer configurations. `<manim-chart>`
  (`ManimChartElement`/`defineManimChart`) is a new custom element that renders
  a static graph once via `CanvasRenderer` (no `Player`/frame-recording
  involved) and layers the interactive camera on top, dispatching
  `manim-chart-pick`/`manim-chart-hover` `CustomEvent`s. `startStudio({
  interactive: true })` wires the same controller into the dev-server's live
  preview via a new `Player.rerenderCurrentFrame()`. See

## 0.0.5

### Fixed
- **`Axes`/`NumberPlane`'s `c2p()` didn't track transforms applied after
  construction** (`shift()`, `moveTo()`, nesting inside a shifted parent,
  etc.), reported as
  [#2](https://github.com/johnhenry/ecmanim/issues/2) — the same category of
  bug as #1, just triggered by a different code path: the *drawn* axis line
  moved (since `shift()` mutates a mobject's `points` directly) but
  `c2p()`/`coordsToPoint()` still computed from frozen construction-time
  scalars (`_leftX`/`unit`), so its output never changed. Fixed at the root:
  `NumberLine.numberToPoint()`/`pointToNumber()` now derive from the axis
  line's *current* rendered endpoints (`axisLine.getStart()`/`getEnd()`) via
  affine-transform-safe interpolation/projection, instead of the frozen
  scalars — so they stay correct under any subsequent shift/scale/rotate, or
  nesting inside a transformed parent group. `Axes.coordsToPoint()`/
  `pointToCoords()` were simplified to sum/project per-axis displacements
  from a shared origin (mirroring upstream Python manim's
  `CoordinateSystem.coords_to_point`), replacing the more fragile
  reference-relative `_xWorld`/`_yWorld`/`_rawYPoint` scalar arithmetic added
  for #1. Added a regression test covering a post-construction `shift()`,
  including the #1 (asymmetric range) + #2 (shift) cases composed together.

## 0.0.4

### Fixed
- **`Axes`/`NumberPlane` placed points at the wrong x-coordinate for any
  `xRange` not centered on zero** (e.g. `[0, 70]`), reported as
  [#1](https://github.com/johnhenry/ecmanim/issues/1). `coordsToPoint()`
  (`c2p`) computed its x-coordinate via `xAxis.numberToPoint()`, which uses
  the `NumberLine`'s pre-shift `_leftX` and ignores the `shift()` applied in
  the `Axes` constructor to re-center the axis on its zero-reference — so the
  *drawn* axis line moved but every plotted point/line/dot didn't, producing
  a constant horizontal offset. Invisible for a symmetric range (shift is
  zero) — exactly why it slipped through the bundled example and test suite.
  Fixed by mirroring the y-axis's already-correct `_yWorld()` pattern with an
  analogous `_xWorld()`, used by `coordsToPoint`, `pointToCoords`, and
  `getXAxisLabel`. Added a regression test asserting `c2p()` output lands on
  the actual rendered axis line for an asymmetric range, plus a round-trip
  `c2p`/`p2c` check.

## 0.0.3

### Added
- A hierarchical `skills/` folder (root `ecmanim` skill + 9 domain skills:
  timeline, captions/audio, voiceover, presentation, interchange, physics,
  authoring-pipeline, studio, render-cli) for LLM coding agents. Ships as
  plain reference material — nothing auto-activates on install.

### Fixed
- **`skills/` was never actually published to npm.** It was committed to git
  but missing from `package.json`'s `files` array, so `0.0.1`/`0.0.2` shipped
  without it despite existing in the repo. Now included.
- `skills/README.md` documents [`skills-npm`](https://github.com/antfu/skills-npm)
  (`npx skills-npm`) as the standard opt-in way to symlink these skills into
  an agent's skills directory, alongside the existing manual copy/symlink
  instructions.

## 0.0.2

### Fixed
- **The published npm CLI was completely broken.** `bin/ecmanim.ts` and
  `bin/py2ts.ts` shipped as raw `.ts` source; Node refuses zero-config
  TypeScript type-stripping for anything under `node_modules`, so every
  `npx ecmanim <command>` and `npx py2ts` crashed immediately with
  `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_NODE_MODULES_TYPE_STRIPPING` for any real install — 100%
  broken for every consumer, every subcommand. Only ever "worked" when run
  from inside a git checkout of the repo itself, which is how it had always
  been tested. Fixed by compiling `bin/*.ts` to `dist/bin/*.js` (new
  `tsconfig.bin.json`) and pointing `package.json`'s `bin` field there.
  Verified against a real `npm pack` + fresh install in an unrelated
  directory, not just source-mode.
- `ecmanim --help`/`-h` with no subcommand exited 1 instead of 0 (only
  `<subcommand> --help` exited 0 correctly).
- **`applyWatermark()` crashed the whole render on ffmpeg builds without
  `libfreetype`** (e.g. Homebrew's default `ffmpeg` formula, which omits the
  `drawtext` filter it needs). Now probes for the filter and warns + no-ops
  instead of throwing, matching the project's established fallback pattern
  (TeX → MathJax, TTS → silent).
- **`renderGL()`/browser `record()` frame-capture pacing.** Captured frames
  were pushed on every `requestAnimationFrame` tick with no throttling, so
  under a headless/software WebGL backend (rAF firing faster than the target
  fps) the captured WebM's wall-clock timestamps compressed the whole clip
  into a fraction of its real runtime (e.g. a 1.4s scene reporting ~0.33s /
  ~117fps). Now paced to each frame's real target time, matching the live
  `play()` path. See [docs/renderers.md](docs/renderers.md).
- **macOS: vector-text font resolution.** `loadVectorFont()`'s fallback font
  scanner only checked Linux font directories, so on macOS (where `fc-match`
  commonly resolves `sans-serif` to a rejected `.ttc` collection) `VText`,
  `MathTex`, and `VectorDecimalNumber` failed with "needs a font" even though
  `checkhealth` reported fonts as OK. The scanner now also checks the standard
  macOS font directories. See [docs/external-tools.md](docs/external-tools.md#macos-notes).
- **Test suite: partial-cache race across concurrently-run test files.**
  `test/media.test.ts` and `test/cli-config.test.ts` both rendered into the
  bare OS tmpdir, so they shared `render()`'s `dirname(output)/partial` cache
  directory; one test's cleanup could delete it while another was mid-render
  under the default parallel test runner, corrupting the ffmpeg concat step.
  Each now renders into its own unique subdirectory.
- The `applyWatermark` test's ffmpeg guard only checked the binary existed,
  not that it had `drawtext` — now checks `ffmpeg -filters` and skips cleanly
  on builds that lack it instead of failing.

### Added
- `examples/plugins-demo.ts` — the plugin system end to end: a native
  `use()` plugin and a portable JSON manifest (`loadManifestFromFile()`)
  together in one scene, including a real shaded 3D surface (`MobiusStrip`)
  defined purely as JSON math expressions.
- `examples/coverage-mobjects.ts`, `examples/coverage-animations.ts` — a
  registry audit found 24 mobjects and 29 animations with zero usage
  anywhere in the repo; these exercise all of them against their actual
  constructor signatures. Example/test coverage is now 121/121 mobjects and
  67/67 animations (100%).

## 0.0.1

The first published release. Version reset to 0.0.1 — the earlier 1.x/2.0
numbers tracked development phases, not releases.

### Renamed
- **Project renamed from `manim-js` to `ecmanim`** ("ecma" + "manim") — package
  name, CLI binary (`ecmanim`, formerly `manim-js`; `bin/ecmanim.ts`), GitHub
  repo (`github.com/johnhenry/ecmanim`), and all docs/examples/import
  specifiers updated. Not yet published, so no compatibility shim or deprecated
  alias was needed. The bundled `manim-wasm` and `manim-portable-plugins`
  sub-packages keep their names — they describe Manim-ecosystem/Python-manim
  compatibility, not this package's brand.

### Fixed
- **Cache soundness — container mobjects.** Segment hashes fingerprinted only an
  animation target's own `points`, which are empty for containers (VGroup,
  vector Text, diagram boards) — so moving/re-styling them between renders
  silently reused stale partial movie files. The fingerprint now walks the whole
  family (found by dogfooding the explainer video; regression-tested in
  `test/hash-invalidation.test.ts`). All existing partial caches invalidate once.
- `AnimationGroup.begin()` had a tautological ternary in the timing rescale.
- Browser backends dropped `finalizeSections()` for construct-function scenes
  (drifted copies of `makeScene`/`runConstruct` — now shared in
  `scene/orchestrate.ts`).
- Explainer/diagram polish: bullets left-anchor instead of centering off-screen;
  diagram arrows trim to node-box boundaries; layered layout gained barycenter
  crossing-reduction sweeps.

### Added
- **TypeScript `strict: true`** across the codebase (was `strict: false`).
- **Frame-snapshot visual regression tests** (`test/snapshot.test.ts` + golden
  PNGs): the first tests that catch "renders but looks wrong"; includes a
  byte-determinism guard for the render cache.
- **Real Format-layer payload**: `explainer` (sections + bullets + diagrams +
  TTS narration), `chart-reveal` (animated bar charts), `quote-card` (social
  aspect presets) — all zero-network with optional LLM enhancement.
- `VoiceoverTracker.timingSource` (`"word-boundaries" | "proportional"`).
- `SimpleEngine` bodies accept `angularVelocity` (kinematic spin).
- `examples/explainer-video.ts` — a real explainer about ecmanim, made by the
  explainer format (dogfooding).

### Docs
- Honesty pass: Lottie static-only scope, OTIO skeleton scope, voiceover
  bookmark-drift warning, SimpleEngine limits, Studio's actual feature set,
  diagram layout limits.

## 2.0.0 — adoption phase 7: authoring layer + Studio

Two new opt-in subpath entries keep the core lean while adding a higher-level
authoring/orchestration layer and a live-preview Studio.

### `ecmanim/authoring`
- **Plan IR + dry-run** (`toPlanIR`/`toPlanString`, CLI `ecmanim plan`): harvest a
  scene's segments/sections/duration as inspectable JSON **without rendering**.
- **Quality gates** (`runQualityGates`, `slideshowRisk`, `checkDeliveryPromise`):
  automated checks incl. a "slideshow-risk" score (is it actually animated?) and
  "delivery-promise" contracts (does the output match a declared intent?).
- **Format lifecycle** (`Format` = `plan`/`generateAssets`/`compose`/`revise`) +
  **provider abstraction** (`llm`/`tts`/`render`), and a **ecmanim render
  provider** + example `title-card` format — so ecmanim can back prompt→video
  pipelines (scrollmark/showrunner-style).

### `ecmanim/studio`
- **Live-preview dev server** (`startStudio`): serves your Scene in a
  `<manim-player>` and **hot-reloads the browser on save** (file-watch + SSE),
  dependency-free. The foundation for checkpoint replay / mouse-camera / eval REPL.
- **`schemaToControls`**: turn a `defineSchema` spec into props-panel control
  descriptors (the data half of a schema-driven editor).

18 new tests (590 total); type-clean; both subpaths build + import; example
`examples/authoring.ts` (format → real render + plan dry-run).

## 1.12.0 — adoption phase 6: physics

- **Analytic EM fields** (`ElectricField`, `MagneticField`, `electricFieldFunc`,
  `magneticFieldFunc`): formula-based vector fields (Coulomb / out-of-plane
  currents) as `ArrowVectorField` subclasses — cheap and deterministic.
- **Waves** (`LinearWave`, `StandingWave`, `WaveCurve`): time-parameterized sine
  curves that advance via an updater.
- **Optics**: `thinLensRefract` (paraxial thin-lens ray bending).
- **Rigid-body**: a dependency-free `SimpleEngine` (semi-implicit Euler + gravity
  + floor collision) stepped per frame (`physics(scene, opts)`), plus an ODE
  `Pendulum`. The engine is pluggable — swap in planck.js (pure-JS Box2D,
  recommended optional dep) or @dimforge/rapier2d for heavy collision/determinism.

10 new tests (582 total); type-clean; example `examples/physics.ts` (field +
pendulum + bouncing bodies).

## 1.11.0 — adoption phase 5: interchange + fidelity

- **OTIO** (`sceneToOtio`, `toOtioJSON`/`fromOtioJSON`, `RationalTime`): export a
  scene's play/wait segments (or sections) as a frame-exact OpenTimelineIO `.otio`
  JSON that round-trips to Resolve/Premiere/FCPXML/EDL. Reimplemented in TS.
- **Lottie import/export** (`vmobjectToLottieShapes`, `vmobjectToLottieJSON`,
  `loadLottie`): map VMobject cubic-Bézier subpaths to Lottie's `{v,i,o,c}` shape
  model and back — export manim shapes to a format every web/iOS/Android Lottie
  player understands (geometry; ThorVG-WASM noted for full fidelity).
- **Watermark** (`applyWatermark`, `render({ watermark })`): burn a text or image
  watermark into the output via an ffmpeg overlay, positionable with opacity.
- **Real-TeX** backend confirmed shipped (`texToSVGViaDvisvgm`: `latex → dvi →
  dvisvgm → SVG → Béziers` with detection + MathJax fallback).

6 new tests (572 total); type-clean; example `examples/interchange.ts`
(watermarked render + `.otio` + Lottie export).

## 1.10.0 — adoption phase 4: animation depth + presentation

- **`TransformMatchingAuto`** — automatic shared-element matching (à la Reveal.js
  Auto-Animate / Motion `layoutId`): pairs pieces across two states by identity
  (`matchId` → text → shape, position-independent), Transforms matched pairs
  (tweening the move/size/color delta) and fades the rest.
- **Presenter controls on `Player`** + `<manim-player>`: `playbackRate`, `volume`,
  `presenterMode` (pause/loop at section boundaries via `SectionType.LOOP`),
  `seekToSection`/`nextSection`/`prevSection`, and keyboard nav (space, arrows,
  `f` fullscreen) + `presenter`/`playback-rate`/`volume` attributes on the element.
- **Diagram-as-code** (`parseDiagram`, `layoutDiagram`, `buildBoard`, `diagram`):
  a tiny Mermaid/D2-ish DSL → deterministic layered/circular layout → a board
  (VGroup of node + edge mobjects tagged with `matchId`), so board-to-board
  transitions animate via `TransformMatchingAuto` (elkjs is an optional future backend).

12 new tests (566 total); type-clean; example `examples/diagram.ts` (board morph).

## 1.9.0 — adoption phase 3: voiceover / TTS-synced narration

- **`voiceover(scene, text, callback, opts)`** (manim-voiceover style): synthesize
  narration, mux it at the current scene time, and get a **tracker** whose
  `.duration` you feed into `play({runTime})` so animations stretch to the speech.
  Inline `<bookmark mark="name"/>` tags + `tracker.waitUntilBookmark("name")`
  trigger animations at specific words. `parseBookmarks` exported.
- **TTS provider abstraction** (`registerTTSProvider`/`resolveTTSProvider`): built-in
  `silent` (no key — a silent clip of the estimated duration, for timing/offline),
  `system` (macOS `say` / Linux espeak), and `openai`/`elevenlabs` HTTP adapters
  (used only when an API key is present). Register your own.

5 new tests (554 total); type-clean; example `examples/voiceover.ts` (bookmark-synced,
runs with the no-key `silent` provider) + docs.

## 1.8.0 — adoption phase 2: captions + audio-reactive

- **Captions** (`parseSrt`/`serializeSrt`, `createTikTokStyleCaptions`,
  `captionAt`, `Caption`): a framework-agnostic caption model + SRT round-trip +
  TikTok-style karaoke pages (token→page grouping). Transcription (Whisper/etc.)
  stays an external step that emits `Caption[]`.
- **`CaptionTrack`** mobject: an in-scene overlay that shows the active caption for
  the current time with optional karaoke reveal (reuses `RasterText.revealFraction`).
- **Audio analysis** (`getAudioData`, `visualizeAudio`, `getWaveformPortion`,
  `createSmoothSvgPath`): decode audio to PCM (Node ffmpeg / browser
  `decodeAudioData`) and get per-frame frequency spectra for audio-reactive
  visuals. Ships a compact dependency-free radix-2 FFT (`fftInPlace`,
  `magnitudeSpectrum`).

12 new tests (549 total); type-clean; example `examples/audio-reactive.ts`
(spectrum bars + captions + muxed audio), docs.

## 1.7.0 — adoption phase 1: pure primitives

First phase of the tool-survey adoption program (Manim / Remotion / GSAP / Motion
Canvas / showrunner / …). Small, dependency-free, isomorphic wins:

- **AE-style expression helpers** (`wiggle`, `remap`, `ramp`, `valueAtTime`,
  `compose`, `mulberry32`): pure, deterministic (order-independent) drivers for
  animating properties from updaters. `wiggle` is value-noise, safe under scrubbing.
- **GSAP-style `Timeline`** (`timeline()`): place animations with a compact
  position grammar (`"+=1"`, `"-=0.5"`, `"<"`/`">"` with offsets, labels, absolute
  seconds) → one `AnimationGroup` for `scene.play()`. Removes manual `t` bookkeeping.
- **`VectorDecimalNumber`**: a live number rendered as crisp vector glyph outlines
  (SVG-friendly, individually animatable digits), mirroring `DecimalNumber`'s
  formatting + edge-fix — fixes the raster gap.
- **`renderStill(scene, {frame|time})`** + a **composition registry**
  (`registerComposition`/`listCompositions`/`compositionsToJSON`) for thumbnails,
  poster frames, and enumerable renderable scenes.
- **Style + aspect-ratio presets**: `STYLE_PRESETS` (named looks incl. `3b1b-dark`)
  and `ASPECT_RATIO_PRESETS` (`16:9`/`9:16`/`1:1`/…); `render()` gains `style` and
  `aspectRatio` options (aspect overrides dimensions; style sets background/font).

27 new tests (537 total); type-clean; verified end-to-end (still + preset renders).

## 1.6.0 — video metadata (schema.org · IIIF · provenance)

Export the web's video metadata standards straight from a render — ecmanim knows
a video's duration, dimensions, and `nextSection()` structure at render time, so
it doesn't have to reverse-engineer them. See [docs/metadata.md](docs/metadata.md).

- **`toVideoObject`** — schema.org `VideoObject` JSON-LD (discovery); chapters
  become `hasPart` `Clip`s. `toVideoObjectScript` returns an embeddable
  `<script type="application/ld+json">`.
- **`toIIIFManifest`** — IIIF Presentation 3.0 Manifest (presentation/navigation):
  Canvas with `duration`, a painting `Video` body, and — the standout —
  **`structures` Ranges (chapters) derived from `nextSection()`**, targeting
  temporal fragments.
- **Provenance sliver** — opt-in `provenance` adds a ecmanim `creator`
  `SoftwareApplication` and the IPTC digital-source-type for algorithmic media
  (folded into both formats). Full IPTC VMH is intentionally out of scope.
- **IIIF ingest** — `loadVideo` (Node + browser) accepts a IIIF manifest (object,
  or a URL with `{ iiif: true }`), resolves the video body URL, and attaches the
  manifest's chapters to the `VideoMobject` (`mob.chapters`). `resolveIIIFVideo`
  is exported. Node reads remote URLs through ffmpeg (cached by URL).
- **`<manim-player>`** injects the `VideoObject` JSON-LD when you set `metadata`
  (off otherwise); also `getVideoObject()` / `injectSchema()`.
- `render()` results now include `sections` (feeds the metadata input).

All isomorphic (exported from `ecmanim`). 15 new tests (510 total); type-clean;
verified end-to-end (scene sections → VideoObject + IIIF manifest, round-tripped).

## 1.5.0 — WebCodecs browser video decode

Upgrades the browser `VideoMobject` path with a WebCodecs decoder, behind the
same synchronous `frameAt()` contract (drop-in; VideoMobject unchanged). See
[docs/video.md](docs/video.md).

- **`WebCodecsProvider`**: demuxes an mp4/mov with `mp4box.js` and decodes the
  whole stream in a single pass through a WebCodecs `VideoDecoder`, then resamples
  the decoded frames onto the target fps grid as `ImageBitmap`s. Much faster than
  the seek-and-capture path (one decode pass vs. O(frames) sequential seeks).
- **`loadVideo` mode `"auto"` (new default)**: prefers `webcodecs` for a URL
  source when the browser supports it and mp4box can demux it, and transparently
  falls back to the dependency-free `precapture` path otherwise (or on any
  demux/decode failure). Explicit `mode: "webcodecs" | "precapture" | "live"`
  still available; `webcodecs` surfaces errors instead of falling back.
- `mp4box` added as a dependency, imported lazily (never at module load) so the
  module stays Node-import-safe and unbundled-browser-safe. Also exports
  `webCodecsAvailable()`.

Verified in live headless Chrome (Mesa): mode `"webcodecs"` demuxed + decoded an
h264 mp4 to 10 `ImageBitmap` frames with correct dims and frame-swapping. 4 new
tests (492 total, WebCodecs decode itself covered by the browser e2e).

## 1.4.0 — VideoMobject (external-video ingestion)

Place an external video clip inside a scene. `VideoMobject` is an `ImageMobject`
whose bitmap is swapped per scene frame to the clip's frame for the current time,
so it plays through `play()`/`wait()` and stays in sync with scene time. See
[docs/video.md](docs/video.md).

- **Isomorphic core** (`VideoMobject`, `VideoFrameProvider`): the class depends
  only on a small sync `frameAt(t)` provider interface; each backend supplies a
  provider. Frame-accurate by construction (exact frame extraction, not
  `<video>` keyframe seeking). Deterministic `dt` accumulation, so it composes
  with the partial-movie cache and `renderParallel`.
- **Node** (`loadVideo`): frames extracted with ffmpeg into a content-hash decode
  cache, pre-decoded to memory for O(1) sync lookup. Optional **audio
  ingestion** — the clip's audio track is muxed into the render via the existing
  `scene.addSound` path (output carries both video + audio). Also exports
  `probeVideo` / `extractFrames`.
- **Browser** (`loadVideo`): a `precapture` provider (dependency-free,
  frame-accurate — seeks a `<video>` and captures each frame to an `ImageBitmap`)
  and a `live` provider (real-time `<video>` passthrough). Node-import-safe; a
  WebCodecs path is noted as a future upgrade.

New example `examples/video.ts` (synthesizes its own clip). 34 new tests
(488 total); type-clean; Node path verified end-to-end (rendered mp4 carrying
both h264 video and muxed aac audio).

## 1.3.0 — alternate renderers

Two opt-in render targets that share the same backend-agnostic scene graph. The
CPU Canvas-2D rasterizer stays the default (its determinism underpins the
content-hash cache); see [docs/renderers.md](docs/renderers.md).

- **SVG / vector output** (`SVGRenderer`, `mobjectsToSVG`, and Node
  `format: "svg"`). A second render backend that emits an SVG document per frame
  — VMobjects → `<path>` cubic Béziers, raster `Text` → `<text>`, `ImageMobject`
  → `<image>` — projected through the exact same `camera.toPixel` as the canvas,
  so geometry matches pixel-for-pixel but is resolution-independent, tiny, and
  editable. `render(Scene, { format: "svg" })` writes a single `.svg` (with
  `saveLastFrame`) or a numbered sequence. Deterministic, no GPU, no browser. 3D
  is a documented painter's-order vector approximation (no per-pixel z-buffer).
- **Opt-in headless GPU** (`renderGL`, Node). Renders the existing Three.js/WebGL
  backend inside a CDP-accessible headless Chrome (WebGL2 via Mesa llvmpipe — no
  physical GPU) and captures the video back to disk, giving real per-pixel
  lighting, MSAA, and GPU strokes. Zero-dependency CDP client (Node global
  `fetch`/`WebSocket`); reuses `browser-three`'s `record()` and the shared
  ffmpeg helpers for webm→mp4/mov. Non-deterministic vs. the CPU path, so it
  stays out of the partial-movie cache. Also exports `probeCDP`/`connectCDP`.

New examples: `examples/svg-output.ts`, `examples/render-gl.ts` (+ the
browser-importable `examples/scenes/gl-demo-scene.ts`). 19 new tests (473 total);
type-clean; both paths verified end-to-end (SVG on disk; GL via live headless
Chrome producing valid H.264/VP9).

## 1.2.0 — Remotion-inspired features

Eight features borrowed from studying [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev)'s
philosophy and source, adapted to ecmanim's imperative, GPU-less architecture
(no React/DOM authoring model, no Chromium-screenshot capture):

- **`interpolate(input, inputRange, outputRange, opts)`** — Remotion-style range
  mapping with `easing` and `extrapolateLeft`/`extrapolateRight` (`clamp` /
  `extend` / `identity` / `wrap`). Claims the bare top-level name; the existing
  2-arg lerp stays namespaced as `bezier.interpolate`.
- **`spring()` / `measureSpring()` / `springRate()`** — analytic (closed-form)
  damped-harmonic-oscillator easing where the duration is *derived* from the
  physics (`mass`/`damping`/`stiffness`/`overshootClamping`). Pure function of
  frame, so it preserves the deterministic content-hash render cache.
- **`Easing.in/out/inOut(fn)` + `Easing.bezier(x1,y1,x2,y2)`** — composable
  easing combinators over any base curve, plus a CSS-style cubic-bezier factory.
- **`renderParallel()` / `discoverSegments()` / `partitionSegments()`** —
  worker-thread parallel rendering that shards play()/wait() *segments* across
  cores and reuses the existing partial-movie-file cache + ffmpeg concat. (The
  segment is the parallel unit; per-frame parallelism is impossible since frame
  N depends on 0..N-1 within a play.)
- **`delayRender()` / `continueRender()` / `waitForRender()`** — a unified
  async-asset gate; the Node renderer now registers font/MathJax warm-up as
  blockers and awaits the gate before running `construct()`.
- **`Sequence()` + `crossFade`/`slide`/`wipe`** — a frame-origin time-shift
  wrapper (extends the AnimationGroup timings machinery) and a mobject-level
  transition catalogue that keeps timing orthogonal to visual presentation.
- **`<manim-player>` Web Component** (`defineManimPlayer()`) — a
  framework-agnostic custom element wrapping `Player`, with attributes,
  imperative `seekTo`/`play`/`pause`, and `ready`/`frame`/`ended` events.
  Node-import-safe (the `HTMLElement` reference is lazily guarded).
- **Typed scene params + `calculateMetadata`** — `defineSchema()` (a tiny local
  validator, no Zod) plus `resolveSceneMetadata()`; the Node renderer resolves a
  scene's static `schema`/`calculateMetadata` to fill fps/width/height defaults.

80 new tests (435 total); type-clean; browser `<manim-player>` verified headless.

## 1.1.0 — prior-art learnings

Features informed by studying other manim/web ports (JazonJiao/Manim.js,
maloyan/manim-web, the Dart manim-web, Motion Canvas, MathBox, ManimGL):

- **Python→TypeScript scene converter** (`py2ts` / `bin/py2ts.ts`): transpiles the
  common manim-scene subset to ecmanim (imports, `Scene` subclass, `self.play`
  → `await this.play`, kwargs → config objects, snake_case → camelCase).
- **Signals reactivity** (`createSignal`/`computed`/`effect`/`reactive`/`bind`): a
  lazy dependency-tracking alternative to updaters/`always_redraw`.
- **Hardened browser MathJax loader**: npm → CDN fallback with handler-registration
  verification (fixes bundler code-splitting breakage). Plus `texToSVG()`.
- **Raster LaTeX** (`MathTexImage`/`mathTexImage`): render a MathJax equation to a
  bitmap for dense/static equations (cheaper than glyph Béziers).
- **Reliable `TransformMatchingTex`**: explicit key matching by tex-part + `keyMap`
  override + `matchingParts()`.
- **In-browser GIF/MP4 export** (`recordGif`/`recordMp4`/`recordVideo` via gifenc +
  WebCodecs/mp4-muxer) alongside the existing WebM.
- **GPU SDF strokes + lighting** in the Three.js backend (`strokeMode: 'sdf'`,
  `lit: true`) — crisp anti-aliased strokes and real GPU-lit surfaces.
- **Optional dvisvgm Node LaTeX backend** (`mathTexDvisvgm`): real TeX → SVG →
  Béziers with a disk cache, graceful fallback to MathJax when TeX is absent.
- **Live playground + scrubber** (`examples/playground/`, `Player`) and a
  `Scene.onLog` observability hook.
- Fix: `polygon-clipping` is now lazily imported so the unbundled browser bundle
  loads (a Phase-4 regression).

## 1.0.0 — manim parity milestone

A near-complete TypeScript port of ManimCommunity manim, delivered as a phased
program (0–8). Renders the same `Scene` code in Node (MP4/WebM/GIF/MOV/PNG) and
the browser (Canvas-2D + optional WebGL/Three.js). ~390 exports, ~120 registered
mobjects, ~67 animations, ~2200 colors, 318 tests, type-clean.

### Highlights by phase

- **Phase 0 — bug fixes.** Real `DashedLine` dashes, `FadeIn`/`FadeOut` `scale`,
  removed the duplicate `Rotate`, `AnimationGroup` linear rate func, `DecimalNumber`
  edge-fix/commas/sign, and default-value parity (Circle=RED, etc.).
- **Phase 1 — TypeScript.** Full migration; Node 25 runs `.ts` directly, `tsc`
  emits `dist/` + `.d.ts`. Type-clean project.
- **Phase 2 — plugin registry.** `use(plugin)` + a typed registry (mobjects,
  animations, rate funcs, colors, scenes); built-ins registered; name-resolving
  `Color.parse` and `running()`.
- **Phase 3 — core infrastructure.** `become`/`saveState`/`restore`/`generateTarget`,
  `match_*`, `applyMatrix`/`applyComplexFunction`, `arrangeInGrid`; VMobject
  smoothing/anchors/partials/background-stroke/gradient; per-submobject `lag_ratio`,
  `reverseRateFunc`, `Transform` `pathArc`; smooth-handle solver, `paths.ts`, and
  the full space-ops (rotation matrices, quaternions, ear-clipping, …).
- **Phase 4 — the missing class library.** Geometry (tips, arcs, Sector/Angle,
  polygrams/Star/RoundedRectangle, boolean ops, Matrix/Table/Brace, Graph/DiGraph);
  vector `Text` (`.chars`/`t2c`) + `MarkupText` + `MathTex` token/part model +
  text-mode `Tex` + Code/Paragraph/Title/Variable; full Axes helpers (area/Riemann/
  secant/tangent/labels) + PolarPlane/ComplexPlane/LogBase + ParametricFunction/
  FunctionGraph/ImplicitFunction + BarChart/SampleSpace + vector fields; 3D solids
  (caps, Dot3D/Line3D/Arrow3D/Prism, polyhedra) + camera gamma/light/fixed-in-frame
  + real ThreeDAxes; the full animation catalogue (~46 added, incl.
  TransformMatchingShapes/Tex, MoveToTarget/Restore, Homotopy, DrawBorderThenFill).
- **Phase 5 — rate functions, colors, constants.** All ease families +
  squishRateFunc etc.; the full ~2200-color palette (core + X11/XKCD/SVG/BS381/
  AS2700/DVIPS) + color utilities; constants/enums.
- **Phase 6 — CLI, config, caching, cameras/scenes.** MovingCameraScene (animatable
  `camera.frame`), ZoomedScene, VectorScene, LinearTransformationScene, Mapping/
  MultiCamera; layered config, partial-movie-file caching, sections; a full CLI
  (`render` flags + `cfg`/`init`/`plugins`/`checkhealth`).
- **Phase 7 — cross-language plugins.** A portable JSON manifest (colors/rate-funcs/
  surfaces/shapes as portable expressions) loadable by both ecmanim and Python
  manim, plus a shared Rust→WASM math core callable from JS and Python (wasmtime),
  verified byte-identical.
- **Phase 8 — parity suite, docs, release.** A structural parity/coverage harness,
  a rendered gallery, a full 50-row parity table, and `docs/` (architecture, CLI,
  plugins).

### Honest divergences

`DecimalNumber` stays raster-backed; `MathTex`/`VText` in the browser need a font
(`setDefaultFont`) / bundler; LaTeX is MathJax→SVG→Béziers (no LaTeX binary); 3D is
CPU projection + z-buffer + Gouraud (no per-pixel Phong); the Python side of the
manifest/WASM needs `manim`/`wasmtime` installed.

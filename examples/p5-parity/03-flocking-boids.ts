// p5.js parity demo 03: ref/03-flocking-boids.js — Craig Reynolds flocking
// (separation/alignment/cohesion) on a toroidal (wraparound) 2D field
// (p5.js gallery, LGPL). The ref seeds 100 boids at the canvas center with
// random initial velocities and lets mouse-drag spawn more; reproduced here
// with a fixed, seeded population spread across the world bounds (no mouse
// input in a headless render) via BoidsFlock's seeded mulberry32 init.
// Proves BoidsFlock (src/mobject/boids.ts, this campaign's gap-fill) driving
// BoidsSimulation (src/layout/boids.ts): deterministic seeded init (never
// Math.random()), weighted steering forces (separation/alignment/cohesion),
// toroidal wrap at the world bounds, and per-boid triangle orientation
// tracking each boid's heading.

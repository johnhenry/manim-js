# VideoMobject — external-video ingestion

`VideoMobject` places an external video clip inside a scene: it is an
`ImageMobject` whose displayed bitmap is swapped, per scene frame, to the clip's
frame for the current time. The clip stays in sync with scene time (updaters
accumulate `dt`), so it plays through `play()` and `wait()` like any other
mobject, and it composes with the partial-movie cache and parallel rendering
because the decode is deterministic.

The decode is **frame-accurate by construction** — instead of relying on
`<video>.currentTime` seeking (which snaps to keyframes), each backend extracts
the exact frame for a target time up front. The core (`VideoMobject`) is
isomorphic and depends only on a small `VideoFrameProvider` interface; the Node
and browser entry points each supply a provider.

## Node (`manim-js/node`)

Frames are extracted with **ffmpeg** into a content-hash-keyed decode cache, then
pre-decoded into memory so per-frame lookup is a synchronous index.

```js
import { render, loadVideo, Scene, Text, Write } from "manim-js/node";

class Clip extends Scene {
  async construct() {
    const video = await loadVideo("input.mp4", {
      width: 7,          // on-screen width in scene units (aspect preserved)
      fps: 30,           // decode fps (default = scene/source fps)
      scene: this,       // required to mux audio
      audio: true,       // extract the clip's audio track into the render
      start: 0, end: 4,  // optional trim (seconds)
      playbackRate: 1,   // optional speed
      loop: false,       // optional
    });
    this.add(video);     // starts playing as scene time advances
    await this.play(new Write(new Text("hi")));
    await this.wait(2);  // the clip keeps playing through the wait
  }
}

await render(Clip, { output: "out.mp4", fps: 30 });
```

- **Audio.** With `{ scene, audio: true }`, the clip's audio is extracted and
  registered via `scene.addSound(...)` at `audioOffset` (default = the scene time
  when `loadVideo` is called); the existing audio-mux path folds it into the
  render. The output mp4 then carries both video and audio streams.
- **Decode cache.** Keyed by `(abs path + mtime + fps + scale + trim)` under
  `<tmpdir>/manim-js-video/<hash>` (override with `cacheDir`). A warm cache skips
  ffmpeg entirely and is byte-identical, so it plays nicely with the content-hash
  partial-movie cache.
- **Memory.** All target frames are decoded to RGBA in memory
  (~`frames × W × H × 4` bytes; a 10s 1080p@30 clip ≈ 2.5 GB). Bound it with
  `scale`/`width` (downscale to on-screen size), `fps` (decode at scene fps, not
  source), and `start`/`end` (trim to the played span). `frameAt()` must be
  synchronous, so there is no lazy/streaming path by design.
- Lower-level helpers `probeVideo(path)` and `extractFrames(path, opts)` are
  exported too.

## Browser (`manim-js/browser`)

```js
import { loadVideo, play } from "manim-js/browser";

const video = await loadVideo("clip.mp4", { mode: "precapture", fps: 30, width: 7 });
// ...add to a Scene and play()/record() as usual.
```

Two providers back it:

- **`precapture` (default) — frame-accurate.** Dependency-free: it seeks a
  `<video>` to each target time, waits for `seeked`, and captures the frame into
  an `ImageBitmap`, building a flat array for synchronous lookup. Right for
  `record()` (deterministic frames). A WebCodecs `VideoDecoder` + demuxer path is
  a documented future upgrade (mp4 demuxing needs a library, so it is not the
  default).
- **`live` — real-time.** Wraps a playing `<video>` element and draws whatever it
  currently shows. Low-latency, not frame-accurate; right for live `play()`.

`loadVideo` accepts a URL or an `HTMLVideoElement` and normalizes it
(`crossOrigin`, `muted`, `playsInline`, awaits `loadedmetadata`). The module is
Node-import-safe (all DOM/WebCodecs access is guarded); calling `loadVideo`
without a DOM throws a clear error.

## Limitations

- Node holds all target frames in memory (see above) — downscale/trim long clips.
- Browser `precapture` seek-and-capture is O(frames) up front; large clips are
  slow to prepare until the WebCodecs path lands.
- 3D/vector renderers draw a `VideoMobject` like any raster `ImageMobject`
  (projected bbox); it is not a textured 3D surface.
